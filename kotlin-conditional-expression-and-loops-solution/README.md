# Conditional expressions and loops

# Topics
- if, else, else-if expression, comparison operators, logic operators, the AND operator &&, the OR operator ||, the NOT Operator, Nested condition, When expression, Range operator, equality operator.
- For, while, foreach

## Basic Requirements
Complete both exercises, write the algorithms and unit tests:

## Exercise 1. Reverse strings
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

  Example 1:
  Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
  Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

  Example 2:
  Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
  Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

## Exercise 2. Permutation in strings
Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.
In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.

  Example 1:
  Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
  Output: true
  Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").

  Example 2:
  Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
  Output: false

  Example 3:
  Input: s1 = "", s2 = ""
  Output: true
