# Introduction

Learn to write functions in Kotlin, and write and run unit tests.

## Objectives

- Functions & Unit tests,
- Single expression functions
- Function literals (anonymous functions, lambda expression), default arguments, name arguments.

## Basic Requirements

## First exercise
- Write a function sum that takes two integers and returns their sum
- Run the unit test for the class Sum

## Second exercise
- In the SpecialFunctions class add a function init that contains an anonymous function that takes as input two numbers and multiply them, assign the  anonymous function to an immutable variable, int the same init function create a lambda function that takes as input two numbers and subtract them, assign the function to an immutable variable; return the sum of the two numbers.
- Write and run at least 4 different unit tests
