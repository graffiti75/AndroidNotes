# Topics
- Recursive algorithm
- Recursive vs iterative algorithm

## Basic Requirements

Complete exercises below, and Unit Tests (when required)

## Exercise 1. Fibonacci (Iterative Solution)

- Implement a function `fib` that implements the [Fibonacci Number](https://elearningindustry.com/fibonacci-sequence-what-is-and-how-applies-agile-development):
  - The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the addition of the last two numbers, starting with 0, and 1
  - The Fibonacci Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55â€¦
  - Written as a rule, the expression is: `Xn = Xn-1 + Xn-2`
- Write a Unit Test for `fib`

## Exercise 2. Fibonacci (Recursive Solution)

- Implement a function `fibRec` that implements the Fibonacci Number in a recursive way
- Write a Unit Test for `fibRec`
