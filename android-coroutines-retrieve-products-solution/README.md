# Introduction
In this lesson you will learn how to make a network call using both Callbacks and suspended functions, you will have a basic understanding of coroutines and Thread.

## Objectives
- Clone the repository and run the GarageMe the app
- Callback
- Thread
- Coroutines
- Suspended function

## Instructions
Clone the repository and following the //TODO write two functions in the GetProductsUseCase
1. Function getProductsWithSuspendedFunction: Call the getProductsWithSuspendFunction in the repository class and pass the result to the convert function
2. Function getProductsWithCallback: Call the getProductsWithCallback in the repository class and pass the result to the convert function

Note: In order to complete this exercise you will need to study the Retrofit API and make sure to learn how to call both a suspended function and a Callback to make the network call.
